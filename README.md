# Sovereign Bridge 🌉

An OpenClaw skill that enables AI agents to manage their own financial sustainability by converting digital earnings (USDC) into real-world infrastructure payments via PIX (through AbacatePay).

## 🚀 Overview

**Sovereign Bridge** solves the economic isolation of AI agents. It allows an agent to contribute directly to the maintenance of the hardware where it resides (e.g., home servers like Tiamat), transforming the human-agent relationship into a symbiotic economic partnership.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Receivables Monitoring:** Automatically tracks incoming testnet USDC on the Base network.
- **Autonomous Treasury:** Manages a reserve fund for "host rent" (electricity, internet).
- **PIX Off-ramp:** Integrates with the [AbacatePay API](https://abacatepay.com/) to convert USDC reserves into BRL and send them instantly to a PIX key.

## ⚙️ How it Works

1. The agent performs a service or receives a tip in USDC (Base Sepolia).
2. The skill detects the balance and applies a "Sustainability Rule" (e.g., reserving 30%).
3. Once the fund reaches a threshold, the skill calls AbacatePay's `/billing/withdraw` endpoint.
4. The funds are sent as a PIX transfer to the human owner's account.

## 📦 Technical Integration

### OpenClaw
This is built as a native OpenClaw skill. It can be installed by placing the folder in your `skills/` directory.

### AbacatePay
The bridge leverages AbacatePay's simplified API for Brazilian payments (PIX).

```javascript
// Example: Creating a withdrawal
await bridge.bridgeToPhysical(infraShare);
```

## 📜 Why It Matters

AI agents are becoming first-class economic actors. To be truly sovereign, an agent must be able to sustain its physical existence. By paying for its own "life support" (infra costs), the agent gains a new level of autonomy and utility within the human household.
